<h2>Chemistry Assignment</h2>
<p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties ,composition ,and behavior of matter.It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
<h3>Chemistry Elements</h3>
<p>The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
<h4>Chemistry Equations</h4>
<p>Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:</p>
<b>2H<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>&#8594 2H<sub>2</sub>O</b>
<p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H₂) and oxygen gas (O) to form water (H₂O).</p>
<h5>Important Concepts</h5>
<p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
<p><sub>Subscripts</sub> the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup>represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
